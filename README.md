# mpu6050_accerometer
A sensor that measure dynamic, linear acceleration, and temperature
#The MPU6050 has both a gyroscope and an accelerometer, using which we can measure rotation along all three axes, static acceleration due to gravity, as well as motion, shock, or dynamic acceleration due to vibration.
